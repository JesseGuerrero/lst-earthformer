# Research Todo List

## Temporal Coverage
- [ ] May 2013 - May 2025 temporal coverage analysis
- [ ] Temporal resolution: 15 days (or similar interval)

## Spatial Coverage  
- [ ] 128 spatial coverage implementation

## Data Implementation
- [ ] Set up personalized cluster systems
- [ ] Do not use overlap between clusters
- [ ] Configure what leads to resulting factors
- [ ] Data Imputation: Interpolate average between channel time points

## Validation & Testing
- [ ] Implement validation
- [ ] Set up timeline: 2013 - 2017, 2022 - 2023, 2024 - 2025
- [ ] In the full dataset we will use 12 months and consume the year before 2022 and 2024 for test and val.
- [ ] Configure hyperparameter space

## Novel contributions
- [ ] Personalized urban feature clustering

## TODO
- [x] Setup data loader for temporal coverage, do  (Just do the years you have)
- [x] Implement average between time points/months
- [x] Implement mixed precision
- [ ] Look up urban features to use for clustering (Do not implement, just propose back to her the features).
- [ ] Look up if average between time points/months is normal

- [ ] Process an entire dataset pipeline
- [ ] Implement test
